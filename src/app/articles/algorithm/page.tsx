        An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules designed to
        perform a specific task or solve a problem. It takes an input, processes
        it through a series of well-defined steps, and produces an output.
        Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are used in various
        applications, from simple calculations to complex data processing and
        artificial intelligence. They ensure tasks are performed efficiently and
        accurately, making them essential for software development, data
        analysis, and automated decision-making. Essentially, algorithms are the
        backbone of all computational processes, driving the functionality of
        modern technology
