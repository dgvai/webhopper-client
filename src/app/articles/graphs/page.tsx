        Graphs are collections of nodes connected by edges, representing
        relationships between entities. Graphs can be used to model social
        networks, computer networks, and transportation networks, among other
        things. They consist of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections between
        nodes). Graphs can be directed or undirected, and they can have cycles
        or be acyclic. Graph traversal algorithms include breadth-first search
        and depth-first search.
