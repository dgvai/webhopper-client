        Trees represent a hierarchical organization of elements. A tree consists
        of nodes connected by edges, with one node being the root and all other
        nodes forming subtrees. Trees are widely used in various algorithms and
        data storage scenarios. Binary trees (particularly heaps), AVL trees,
        and B-trees are some popular types of trees. They enable efficient and
        optimal searching, sorting, and hierarchical representation of data.
