        A computer is an electronic device that processes data and performs
        tasks according to a set of instructions called software. It consists of
        hardware components like the central processing unit (CPU), memory,
        storage, and input/output devices. Computers can execute a wide range of
        applications, from simple word processing to complex scientific
        simulations. They have become integral to modern life, enabling
        communication, entertainment, education, and business operations. By
        automating repetitive tasks and handling large volumes of data
        efficiently, computers have revolutionized how we work, learn, and
        interact with the world.
